The program is a university food review application that shows the daily menus of different restaurants at several different universities in Finland. 
The dishes contain user-specific reviews which can be created more of with user accounts.
Food reviews can only be added to foods that have been previously served, and the user can only add a review once for the same food but can edit an old one. 
Both normal and admin users can be found in the application. 
Admin users have additional features, such as removing and hiding reviews from other users, and bypassing 2-step authentication. 
Users can view the reviews they have made on the “Own Reviews” page, which shows the reviews published by the user and review drafts the user has made.
Reviews can also be edited from this page. 
They can also be set as published or back as drafts. 
However, reviews with all evaluation criteria of 0 and nothing entered in the text field cannot be published. 
The “Account” page of the application allows you to view and edit user information. 
User's old password is required when changing user information. Whilst changing the password, the user has to follow the same criteria as when creating an account password, which are marked above the text box. 
On the “Settings” page the user can change the language of the application between Finnish and English.
