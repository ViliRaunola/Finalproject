# Finalproject

The program is a University food review application that shows the daily menus of different restaurants at several different universities. 
The dishes contain user-specific reviews that can be done more with other user accounts. 
Food reviews can only be added to foods that have been previously served, and the user can only add a review once for the same food. 
Both normal and Admin users can be found in the application. 
Admin users have additional features, such as removing and hiding reviews from other users, and bypassing 2-step authentication. 
Users can view the reviews they have made on the “My Reviews” page, which shows the reviews and review drafts already posted by the user. 
Reviews can also be edited from this page. 
They can also be set as published or back as drafts. 
However, reviews with all evaluation criteria of 0 and nothing entered in the text field cannot be published. 
The “Account” page of the application allows you to view and edit user information. 
An old password is required when exchanging information. When you change your password, 
you have the same criteria as when you create a user account, 
which are marked above the text box. 
On the “Settings” page you will find the language exchange between Finnish and English.

Files that are located in Assests folder have to be moved to App's local memory. Path: /data/data/com.example.finalproject/files/
